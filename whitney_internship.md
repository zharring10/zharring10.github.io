First Day! I did some of the formalities like signing the internship agreement, getting access to the CMS and staff pages, and completed the first task, which was researching quotes for press articles to create the Protest exhibition's In The News section.

Tuesday 09/12

I got an introduction to the CMS by Aliza, and different section of the website such as the Shop, Essays and Education. Then I continued with finding quotes from press articles about some current exhibitions: the Bunny Rogers, Willa Nasatir and HÃ©lio Oiticica. Next I uploaded the quotes to the exhibition pages. Aliza took me on a short tour to check if the detour app, which is an online app that can be used instead of the audio guide is working correctly. It is currently in development. I also uploaded some information for the Protest exhibition audio guide. It was fashion week, so the entire lobby was blocked for a show in the Whitney later that evening.

My supervisor, Elyse, took me on the curator led tour of the Protest exhibition. I specifically enjoyed hearing more about Senga Nengudi's work, since I saw some of her work in the Henry Gallery at University of Washington a while ago. Some of her pieces are part of the Whitney collection. I also read about "Orbit" a performance that was staged at the Whitney in February 2017 over a period of 11 days. It was part of an exhibition about Mars and travelling in space. The three performers lived between a window and a glass wall on very restricted space inside the Whitney museum for more than a week as the performance.

Aliza gave me a spreadsheat for the audio guide of the Where We Are and Protest exhibition. I checked for completeness, if images, transcripts and audio was uploaded and if all episodes where uploaded in Spanish and the kids, adults and access section.

Wednesday 09/20

Attended a 1.30h meeting about usability of the website and outcomes from a user study. Focusing mostly on terminology and path finding.

Monday 09/25

I uploaded some images for the upcoming Electrostatics exhibition to the internal database. We had a group lunch on a staff terrace and Aliza provided training on how to upload blog posts to the Education section of the website. I also got admin access to the staff website.

Tuesday 09/26

I started working on my first assigned projects on the website, which included uploading three blog posts and changing the sections on the Edcation page. I also assisted Elyse with the Dred Scott interview for the Whitney stories section.
