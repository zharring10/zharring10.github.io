**Materials:** Cell Image Library, Acrylic sheets, Molotow One4All Markers, cardboard  

**Dimensions:** 7 layers,  8 inches x 10.5 inches each

I performed an edge detection algorithm by applying an edge detection filter to an image of a neuron from the Cell Image Library. This process is usually carried out by a computer and requires mathematical operations, however, I was curious if I could get a sensible result if I performed the algorithm manually. In order to express different mathematical values I used white, black and different gray markers. I also created transparent filters that I could slide over the original image.
