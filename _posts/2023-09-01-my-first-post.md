**Materials:** pen, paper, bench, rejected sketches, shelf, sketchbook, video and audio recording  
**Dimensions:** 10 minutes video

**Artist statement:** I want to let go of the idea that I can control what others think about me. I often find myself speculating about what other people’s expectations and judgments will be when I work, attaching my self-worth to other’s positive reactions. This often leaves me feeling too afraid of negative judgment to feel comfortable enough to share my work. By drawing in public spaces, I seek to confront this construction of my identity and worth that is based on other people’s perceptions. Potentially having people look over my shoulder or comment on my work forces me to overcome my doubt, by denying me the option to hide. In order to stop myself from doing the compulsive work of guessing, I will give my work away and record other’s responses to my work as a way to replace my anticipation. If my sketches are rejected they are shown on a reject pile in the gallery. Alongside the sketchbook and rejected sketches, I am showing a video of my process including recordings of responses to my sketches. Through this way of working, I hope to explore a sense of self that exists under my worry and doubt about what I can safely share.
